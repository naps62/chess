# 4.1

First thoughts:
- Ba6 forces Ra8 (otherwise Bf4 wins another tempo and loses the exchange)

- If ...O-O (if it was black's turn), white can try
d5 exd5 Bxd5 Bxh7+ to weaken the black king (but sacrifing a center pawn)

- d5 exd5 exd5 Bxd5 Bb5 (followed by Rd1 and c4. Knight is pinned to the king,
    and by extension the bishop is pinned to the knight)

    but Bc6 Bxc6 Rxc6 solves it for black. So the rook on the c file is the
    problem, so...

## Final answer:

1.Ba6 Ra8 (Rc7 Bf4 e5 Nxe5 Nxe5 Bxe6 and white has a strong center and attacks 
g7)
2.d5 exd5
3.exd5 Bxd5
4.Bb6 O-O
5.Rd1

undefended bishop. If bishop moves away, the knight falls. Bc6 doesn't
work because the rook was kicked off the c file. If black didn't castle, to
keep the king defending the rook


# 4.2

1.e6 (threatens Qxf7#, so white can't ignore)
1...fxe6 (Bxe6 Nxe6 fxe6 Qh5+)
2.Qh5+ g6
3.Qxg5 Qxg5
4.Bxg5

White is now up a piece

# 4.3

First thoughts:
- Qb3 threatens f6, so white develops the queen with tempo

Final answer:
1.Bxf7 Kxf7
2.Qb3+
  - 2...Ke8 3.Ng5 Rf8 4.Ne7 (queen is out)
  - 2...Kf8 3.Ng5 Qe8 (only move, to prevent Ne6 double threat) 4.Ne6+ Kg8 5.Nxc7+ (queen
      is out again)

# 4.4

Final answer:

1.e5
  - 1...Nxe5 2.Qxe5 Bxb5 3.Qxb5 (white wins a piece)
  - 1...Nxe5 2.Qxe5 Qxe5 3.Bxd7+ Rxd7 4.Nxe5 (white wins a piece)

The pawn is defended twice on e5, and takes the black queen off a good diagonal.
White is now free to develop his b1 knight (which was defending the queen
before). White can now focus an attack on f7 (Bc4, Ng5, Qb3), or on the
kingside (Na3, Rc1, focusing on the c7 pawn)

# 4.5

(It's black to play, right?)

First thoughts:
- A kight on c2 would do a triple fork. White can't castle either side, and c2
    is defended by the black queen, so preventing this is hard.

- Maybe Bb4 ? with the idea of cxb4 Nxb4. It's impossible to stop Nc2. The next best thing is
    Rc1 Nc2+ Rxc1 Qxc1, which threatens both Qd1# and Qb1 Ke2 Qd1#

- Qc2 right away seems to be premature, because of Rc1. Black wins the a2 pawn,
    but meh...

Final answer:

1.O-O

Black's king is still a bit exposed, but white is blocked from castling and has
a ruined pawn structure. His pieces seem to be a bit weird, but with the queen
pointing at the king, it feels safer to castle, and be able to double to rooks
on the open d-file

# 4.6

First thoughts:

- Annoying bishop on e4
- Knight on f3 has no good squares to go to, which makes it hard to play f3 and
    kick the bishop
- Black king is stuck in the middle
- Queen is tied to defending e6

Final answer:

1.Ng1
  - 1...Bxg2 2.Bg4 Qxg4 3.Qxe6#
  - 1...Bf5 (to prevent Bg4) 2.e4 Bxe4 Bg4
  - 1...Qe5 2.f4

# 4.7

Final answer:

1.e5
  - 1...dxe5 Nxe5 (threatening Nxg5 or Nxd7 with discoveries on the queen)
  - 1...Nh5 exd5 exd5 Rae1+ Kf8

if Nh5 exd5 (with tempo on the queen). exd5 opens the king file for a rook.
Queen retreating allows for dxe7. If Nxf4, Rae7 secures the e7 pawn, ties the
king to an open center file, and probably makes the sacrifice completely worth
it

# 4.8

First thoughts:

- Nd5 threatens Nc7 (fork) Qxc7 Bxf7+ Kxf7 Rxc7. So black has to reply with
    Bd6, Bd8, or O-O, or even Kd8 or Kf8
- Nd5 also defends e3 and allows f4 later
- Bxf7 at some point looks tasty

Final answer:

1.Nd5
  - 1...Bd6 2.f4 Qh5 Qxh5 gxh5 Nf5 (bishop is trapped)
  - 1...Bd8 2.f4 Qh5 Qxh5 gxh5 Nf5 (threatens Ne8+ Kf8 Nxh5 winning a pawn, and

# 4.9

First thoughts:

- Black can't castle because the f7 pawn falls
- Nxf7 could be interesting, but I don't immediately see a follow-up

Final answer:

1.Rd2
  - 1...Qxg2 2.Rhd1 Rd8 3.Qb5 (knight falls)
  - 1...Qxg2 2.Rhd1 O-O-O Nxf7 (wins material)
  - 1...Rd8 2.Rhd1 (no way to prevent Qd3, which ends up winning the knight)
  - 1...Ne5 2.Qf4 (attacks both the knight and f7)

# 4.10

Final answer:

1.d3

Open the bishop, which is the last minor piece to develop, and consider castling
queen side. Black is underdeveloped, and his queen is undefended. Covering that
diagonal with the bishop can help restrict it later on. Be3, Qd2, O-O-O and
white is safe, doubled on the d file, and ready to push d4.

# 4.11

Final answer:

1.O-O (bring a rook to an open file. Bxf3 can now help double the rooks)

I couldnt' find a more immediate plan. White has 3 pieces ready for attack
(bishop, queen, and knight), and gets two rooks on open files. Black only two
pieces defending (queen and rook). White also has an open king in the middle
(Qh4+, or f6 to open the file could end up leaving the king exposed)

# 4.12

Final answer:

1...Re8

- 2.Qf3 Qh4 3.g3 Qh3 (black can now attack on the light squares, which are
    weakened on the kingside, and white has no light-squared bishop)

2.Qd3, 2.Qc2 are also possible, but they seem to allow the same line
2.Qd5 doesn't look safe for white
