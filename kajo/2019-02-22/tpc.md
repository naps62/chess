# 4.1

First thoughts:
- Ba6 forces Ra8 (otherwise Bf4 wins another tempo and loses the exchange)

- If ...O-O (if it was black's turn), white can try
d5 exd5 Bxd5 Bxh7+ to weaken the black king (but sacrifing a center pawn)

- d5 exd5 exd5 Bxd5 Bb5 (followed by Rd1 and c4. Knight is pinned to the king,
    and by extension the bishop is pinned to the knight)

    but Bc6 Bxc6 Rxc6 solves it for black. So the rook on the c file is the
    problem, so...

## Final answer:

Ba6 Ra8 (Rc7 Bf4)
d5 exd5
exd5 Bxd5
Bb6 O-O
Rd1

undefended bishop. If bishop moves away, the knight falls. Bc6 doesn't
work because the rook was kicked off the c file. If black didn't castle, to
keep the king defending the rook


# 4.2

e6 (threatens Qxf7#, so white can't ignore)
...fxe6 (Bxe6 Nxe6 fxe6)
Qh5+ g6
Qxg5 Qxg5
Bxg5

White is now up a piece

# 4.3

First thoughts:
- Qb3 threatens f6, so white develops the queen with tempo

Final answer:
Bxf7 Kxf7
Qb3+
  - Ke8 Ng5 Rf8 Ne7 (queen is out)
  - Kf8 Ng5 Qe8 (only move, to prevent Ne6 double threat) Ne6+ Kg8 Nxc7+ (queen
      is out again)

# 4.4

Final answer:

e5

if ...Nxe5 Qxe5 Bxb5 Qxb5 (white wins a piece)
if ...Nxe5 Qxe5 Qxe5 Bxd7+ Rxd7 Nxe5 (white wins a piece)

The pawn is defended twice on e5, and takes the black queen off a good diagonal.
White is now free to develop his b1 knight (which was defending the queen
before). White can now focus an attack on f7 (Bc4, Ng5, Qb3), or on the
kingside (Na3, Rc1, focusing on the c7 pawn)

# 4.5

(It's black to play, right?)

First thoughts:
- A kight on c2 would do a triple, fork. White can't castle either side, and c2
    is defended by the black queen, so preventing this is hard.

- Maybe Bb4 ? with the idea of cxb4 Nxb4. It's impossible to stop Nc2. The next best thing is
    Rc1 Nc2+ Rxc1 Qxc1, which threatens both Qd1# and Qb1 Ke2 Qd1#

- Qc2 right away seems to be premature, because of Rc1. Black wins the a2 pawn,
    but meh...


Final answer:

Not sure, really
