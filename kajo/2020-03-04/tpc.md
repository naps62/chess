## 1

candidate moves:
- g5
- f6
- Rd2

1.f6
  1...gxf6 Rxd6 Bxd6 Qxf6 Qc7 (black defends both threats, doesn't work)
  1...g6 Qe4 (no defense against Qxg6 or Bxf7)
  1...gxf6 g5 (opening up the h file and a potential attack on f7, seems promising)
  1...Rc7 fxg7 Bxg7 Rxd6 (wins a pawn and activates the rook)
  1...Rc7 fxg7 Kxg7 Rhf1 (doubling against f7)

1.g5
  1...hxg5 hxg5 (threatening Qh5)
  1...h5 Qxh5
  1...Rd7 gxh6 gxh6 Rhg1+ (followed by Qg2 or Qg4)

Is black threatening anything?

- Bxb2 can be ignored
- Rxc2 doesn't work
- Qc7 is slow and can be defended with Rd2 (or it also probably doesn't work either, after Bxc2 and Ka1)
