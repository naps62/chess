candidate moves:

- b4
- b3

black is threatening c4, gaining space, and locking down pieces on the queen side

b3 c4 bxc4 bxc4 (black now has a passed pawn)
b3 c4 Bb2 Qc7 (black threatening c3, gaining a passed pawn)

b3 seems passive, and doesn't prevent c4

b4 forces an answer. cxb4 clears the c file, and makes Bb2 a lot stronger (no way to block it with a pawn)

b4 cxb4 Bb2 Nc6 e5 Nc5
b4 Nc6 bxc5 Nxc5 Bb2
