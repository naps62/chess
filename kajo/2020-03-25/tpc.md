# TPC2

Candidate moves:

- Rd8
- Rg8
- Bf6
- Qc3
- Kf8

1. Bf6 can be met with Qb3, so doesn't loo good

1.Rd8 Qxg7 Rxd3 Qxh8+ Bf8 Bf1 (doesn't work)

1.Qc3 Rg1 Bf6 R

Summary:
Bf6 seems premature (Qb3 either trades queens or gives back some initiative to white)
Rg8 seems passive. Rac3 now gains a file for the rook
Rd8 Qxg7 seems to lose
Qc3 first, puts the queen on an active diagonal, prevents counterplay, and allows white to keep on that long diagonal
(Qb3 Qd5), followed by Kf8, which keeps ideias of pushing h4, or even Rh6 to activate the rook later

fxe5 doesn't seem to work after Bxd1 Qxd1 dxe5
f5 Bxd1 Qxd1 seems much more promising. Closing his pieces, undermining black king's protection, under opening diagonals
for the queen and dark squared bishop to enter.
